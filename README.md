Accurate measurement of body fat is inconvenient/costly and it is desirable to have easy methods of estimating body fat that are not inconvenient/costly. Using regression techniques, it is possible to come up with the best results for the measurement of body fat.
The dataset was obtained from CMU StatLib website. It consists of the percentage of body fat determined by underwater weighing and various body circumference measurements for 252 men. 

The objective of the project is to provide significant parameters which influences the response. The analysis includes fitting a linear model followed by checking for the model assumptions, multicollinearity, steps followed to eliminate it (principal component regression), significance test of the model. I have done this model building in R programming.
